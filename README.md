# CSC4005_2025-26Fall

## Prologue

Welcome to take course **CSC4005: Parallel Programming** offered by The Chinese University of HongKong, Shenzhen. In this semester, you will learn the basic principal and philosophy of parallel programming, including embarrassingly parallelism, reduction, synchronization, load balancing and so on. After taking this course, you should be familiar with popular parallel programming languages for both CPU and GPU, and be able to use them to design efficient parallel programs.

## Parallel Programming Languages Used in This Course

- **On CPU**
  - Vectorization
    - This course now focuses on compiler directed vectorization instead of writing SIMD intrinsics.
  - MPI (Message Passing Interface)
    - This course now focuses on shared-memory parallel programming, and we just briefly cover MPI in Project 1.
  - Pthread
  - OpenMP
- **On GPU**
  - CUDA
  - OpenACC
  - Triton
